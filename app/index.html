                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>Derrick Gregory grew up in Chesapeake, Virginia, close to where Interstate 64 ends. He moved to Richmond, Virginia in 2007 when he transferred from Old Dominion University in Norfolk to Virginia Commonwealth University. He graduated from VCU in 2009 with a degree in urban studies and geography.</p>

                <p>Kelly Hall grew up in St. Peters, Missouri, not far from the other end of Interstate 64. She graduated from Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri in 2010 wiht a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies: Human Geography and a minor in Environmental Studies.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  Derrick and Kelly’s mutual interest in cities, plants, biking, and traveling blossomed into a relationship.
                </blockquote>
                <p>In 2010, Derrick was searching for career options and was encouraged by a professor to re-enroll in Virginia Commonwealth University for a 1-year GIS Certificate. At the same time, Kelly was also figuring out career options and was offered a graduate assistantship at VCU by the same professor.</p>

                <p>Over the summer, Kelly happened to stay at Derrick’s friends house while looking for apartments in Richmond. The room was open because the friend was traveling in Indonesia with Derrick.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, August 18, 2010, Kelly and Derrick met at a meet-and-greet school orientation for their programs. Kelly had only been in Richmond for 3 days. That Saturday, Derrick invited Kelly out on a bike ride to Chimborazo Park, a vegetarian dinner at Ipanema Cafe, and then to Bollywood Night.</p>

                <p>Derrick and Kelly’s mutual interest in cities, plants, biking and traveling blossomed into a relationship.</p>

                <p>On June 8, 2013, Derrick proposed to Kelly at Chimborazo Park.</p>

          <h1>Meet Us in St. Louis!</h1>
          <img src="/images/stl_large.jpg" alt="Map of St. Louis City">
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="column two-thirds"></div>
            <h2>Top St. Louis Attractions</h2>
            <h3>City Museum</h3>
            <p>If you manage to do nothing else in St. Louis but go to the City Museum, then your time will still be well spent. Trust us. Housed in the 600,000 square-foot former International Shoe Company, the museum is a combination playground, museum, surrealistic pavilion, and architectural marvel made out of unique, found objects. The thing is made from old chimneys, salvaged bridges, construction cranes, a bank vault, miles of tile, and even two abandoned planes! Plus, it has a restaurant and serves alcohol. Ten story indoor slide? Ferris wheel on the roof?? Seriously, this place is amazing and great for all ages.</p>
            <h3>Missouri Botanical Gardens</h3>
            <p>The city’s botanical gardens boast the largest japanese garden in North America and a huge climatron inside of a geodesic dome. Located on 79 acres next to Tower Grove Park, this place has something for everyone, even if you’re not very into plants. Make sure to check out the Corpse Flower in the old greenhouse!</p>
            <h3>Breweries: AB, Schafly, Urban Chestnut and More!</h3>
            <p>Yes, St. Louis is the headquarters of Budweiser beer - and they do tours.  The sprawling complex includes 189 structures spread over 142 acres, including many red brick Romanesque ones with square crenelated towers and elaborate details. Check out the gargoyles and the clock tower when you’re there! Even if you’re not into drinking (or are too young) it’s still an impressive place. The clydesdales and the Bevo bottling plant are the highlights. No sign-up necessary and totally FREE of charge!  Did we mention the two free drinks at the end of the tour?</p>
            <p>Craft beer more your thing? Bud may be America's beer, but Schlafly is "The St. Louis Brewery." Founded in 1991, they tout themselves as "the first bewpub in Missouri since prohibition." Two locations: Schlafly Taproom is right around the corner from the Drury Inn, and Schafly Bottleworks is located in Maplewood just outside city limits near Forest Park. The Bottleworks location does tours. The K&ouml;lsh is a personal favorite of Derrick and Kelly!</p>
            <h3>St. Louis Local Cuisine</h3>
            <p>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands and thousands of German, Irish, and Italian immigrants came to St. Louis and gave the city a host of neighborhoods, with food and restaurants to boot. Toasted ravioli, Pork steak, St. Louis style pizza (made with Provel Cheese), St Louis style ribs, and Gooey Butter Cake (among other delicious baked goods) top off the list.</p>
            <h3>Forest Park</h3>
            <p>Larger than Central Park in New York, Forest Park hosted the 1904 World's Fair &amp; Summer Olympics. Within its boundaries are the Zoo, the History Museum, the Art Museum, the Science Center, the World's Fair Pavillion, and the Municipal Theatre (the Muny). All of which are 100% free!!! What, a free zoo?!? Seriously, you have no excuse to not go here.</p>
